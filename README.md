# BettingGame

This is a networked game (Netcode) where two players can bet on whether an object will change it's color to Red or Green. 

I put this together pretty quickly, only worked on it for a week. I learned a lot about Netcode working on this. I may come back to it in the future to fix some isssues and polish it up.
